Notes on DevContainers and its dependencies

Install and Verify Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) on Developer Laptops for DevContainer POC

Description:
Developers working on the DevContainer Proof of Concept (POC) require Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) to be installed and verified on their development laptops.

Acceptance Criteria:
Given a developer's Windows laptop meets the system requirements,
When the installation steps for WSL2 are followed,
Then WSL2 is successfully installed on the laptop.
AND
Given WSL2 is installed,
When the developer checks the WSL version with wsl --version or wsl --list,
Then WSL2 commands are executed successfully.


Title:
Enable Virtual Machine Platform on Workstation


Description:
Developers working on the DevContainer Proof of Concept (POC) require the Virtual Machine Platform feature to be enabled on their Windows workstations. Enabling this feature is essential for supporting virtualization technologies that are prerequisites for running DevContainers effectively.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given a developer's Windows workstation meets the system requirements,
When the developer enables the Virtual Machine Platform feature through Windows Features or PowerShell,
Then the Virtual Machine Platform is successfully enabled on the workstation.
AND
Given the Virtual Machine Platform feature has been enabled,
When the developer verifies the feature status using DISM /Online /Get-FeatureInfo /FeatureName:VirtualMachinePlatform (elevated command prompt),
Then the command confirms that the Virtual Machine Platform is enabled.

Title:
Install PodMan Desktop on EDT Developer Laptop


Description:
Developers in the EDT team require PodMan Desktop to be installed on their development laptops to provide a Docker-compatible engine within the Windows environment. This is essential for running DevContainers, which rely on Docker commands and compatibility to create isolated and consistent development environments.  Installing PodMan Desktop will enable seamless execution of Docker-compatible commands, ensuring that DevContainers can be used consistently and efficiently across all development environments.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given a developer's laptop meets the system requirements,
When the installation steps for PodMan Desktop are followed,
Then PodMan Desktop is successfully installed on the laptop.
AND
Given PodMan Desktop is installed,
When the developer launches PodMan Desktop,
Then the application starts without errors and the Docker-compatible engine is operational.
AND
Given PodMan Desktop is operational,
When the developer runs a basic Docker command (e.g., docker run hello-world),
Then the container executes successfully and displays the expected output.
AND
Given PodMan Desktop is installed and verified,
When the developer integrates Docker CLI with PodMan Desktop,
Then Docker commands are seamlessly executed using the PodMan engine.


Title:
Import RHEL9 Linux Distro to WSL2


Description:
Developers working on the DevContainer Proof of Concept (POC) require the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL9) distribution to be imported into Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2). Importing RHEL9 is essential for creating a consistent and reliable Linux environment tailored to the project's needs. This setup ensures that DevContainers can leverage the specific configurations and dependencies provided by RHEL9, enhancing development efficiency and environment consistency.

Acceptance Criteria:
Given WSL2 is installed and verified on a developer's Windows laptop,
When the developer follows the steps to import the RHEL9 distribution,
Then RHEL9 is successfully imported into WSL2.
AND
Given RHEL9 has been imported into WSL2,
When the developer launches the RHEL9 distribution,
Then the RHEL9 shell starts without errors and is operational.
AND
Given RHEL9 is operational within WSL2,
When the developer verifies the distribution version using cat /etc/os-release,
Then the system confirms that RHEL9 is correctly installed.
AND
Given RHEL9 is installed and running,
When the developer sets RHEL9 as the default WSL2 distribution,
Then RHEL9 launches automatically when executing the wsl command without specifying a distribution.
